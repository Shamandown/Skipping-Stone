			<p>The stars are too cruel out in the void. That's the best word I had for it. Cruel. Being in orbit is fine: with Earth taking up a good slice of the view, at least I had something to orient on. But out here, only ¼ of one degree along Earth’s orbit toward <a href= https://www.space.com/30302-lagrange-points.html target="_blank">L5</a> — which doesn’t sound very far until you do the math — home wouldn't be more than a blot in the black if I could see it. (But I’d have to go outside to look back past the bulk of our tiny ship to do that, which I certainly would <em>not</em> do!) So I stared out the main canopy at the big empty. There was no shelter. The cosmos glared crushingly down at me and let me know, moment-to-moment, that I was nothing but a little blot myself. Less than, in fact.
			</p><p>I didn’t want to keep on gazing out into the dark, but I had little else to choose from. Edwin sat at the helm, glaring out into the empty like a taut hawk poised to sink its beak into the entrails of some warm, squirming morsel. I sat over his shoulder at the navigator’s station, which kept trying to tell me we didn’t have enough fuel to make it home, and were going to die. Edwin had assured me he had a plan, and I had to believe him because he was smarter than me, but the red-bordered flashing notices were wearing down my confidence. I certainly hadn’t brought a book or knitting or any other distraction with me on this strange errand, so there was little I could do but stare out our shuttle’s canopy and contemplate our impending, futile doom.
			</p><p>“Should we um…”
			</p><p>“<em>Hush</em>, Rupert.” said Edwin — Dr. Edwin Haskell Rattleboot, though he insisted against the formality — without taking his gaze off the vast empty. He normally wasn’t so cold. He Edwin hung his tablet in the air where I could see it. There was a countdown on the screen fast approaching zero. He continued with a more measured voice, “Please. Patience.”
			</p><p>I pressed, “I just thought we should prime the long-range, if we’re to watch the Skipping Stone’s next blink?”
			</p><p>That’s why we were out here, though Edwin had been short on details. The Skipping Stone had first been spotted weeks ago, hurtling through the Kuiper Belt at a little over 150km/s, faster than any comet or indeed any man-made object. It whizzed past many of the larger objects out there, banking and slowing slightly in the tug of their gravity fields. Zippy as it was, it had no energy signature. All the data we could get on it showed it to be just another rock a few kilometers across, an extra-solar wanderer with a fair sight more oomph than any we’d recorded to date. A curiosity among astronomers, but not really a news item, until it skipped out of existence and reappeared several billion kilometers away, slipping into an aerobraking hyperbola through Neptune’s upper atmosphere. The whole world had started watching then, tracking as it blinked across the void to Uranus, aerobraking again, then skipping off to each planet in turn, changing course, bleeding off speed and then skipping right over the billions of kilometers of empty space between.
			</p><p>“I still don’t get how we’re going to see it skip to Mars any better from out here than all the people and fancy kit crowded out at L2.” I usually trusted Edwin — he was way smarter than me, and I’m no dunce — but this really made no sense. He’d grabbed me from my cubby on ZenithTech’s orbital lab, wild-eyed and whispering about correlations no-one else had seen. He’d skulked through the station, avoiding others like he was carrying a state secret, and taken one of the station’s shuttles out of dock, just the two of us aboard. Before I’d barely strapped in he’d fired us on a full burn, hurling us far out of Earth Local and back along Earth’s orbit toward L5. I didn’t want to think about that, so I said, “Really, if you want to see anything, we need to give the LRS time to—”
			</p><p>The timer hit zero.
			</p><p>Edwin made his hand into a finger-gun and pointed at a blot that had just appeared against the stars far ahead and shouted, “There!”
			</p><p>A split-second later my nav station lit up with proximity alerts. I stammered, struggling to comprehend what was happening.
			</p><p>“Hah!” crowed Edwin. “Oh, to see the looks on the faces of those gobshites from the Frame Institute and the rest of the rabble at L2! We got the drop on them, Rupert! We got the drop on them <em>hard!</em>”
			</p><p>“Wait,” I blurbled, “is-issat the Skipping Stone?” Scanner data poured across my screens: the object was several kilometers across its thickest point; velocity around 50km/s; composition mostly carbon, stone, metals. So the Skipping Stone definitely <em>wasn’t</em> a Kuiper Belt native, which were primarily frozen volatiles. I gaped at Edwin and said, “H-how? How'd you know? Everyone thought... But how'd you...?”
			</p><p>I could see it now. We were the first people to visually examine the thing, and it was terrifying. It was shaped somewhat like a bedbug, a flattened lump with jagged black peaks jutting from its edge like teeth, and craggy ridges crossing its flanks.
			</p><p>“In a moment.” He wedged his tablet in a crevice and started toggling sliders on the control field, warming up the engines. “First we need to grab a ride. Find us a cozy Anchor site, would you? We'll be flying off-the-cuff, as it were, but a target would really help.” He spun our ship about and fired a burn to push us along parallel to the Skipping Stone's course.
			</p><p>The words rang like static in my head. He meant to land on it? It was coming up fast, from behind us now. Even at maximum burn it was still going to be going 10km/s faster than us when it passed, unless we jettisoned some significant mass. The last two hundred years of advancements in spaceflight had brought us quite a ways, but our ship would still shatter like an egg against that carbon mountain. There were a million ways we could die attempting to intercept that thing! On the other hand, we didn't have enough fuel to make it back, and I didn't know how long the life support could keep us alive if we went adrift.
			</p><p>“Rupert!” Edwin bellowed and he trimmed the hard burn that was shaking our tin can like a rock tumbler. “Find me a site!” He toggled a few more sliders on his screens. Hollow thuds rang through the hull, and the ship lurched like the end of the world. “I don’t fancy eenie-meenie-ing this one!”

			<p>I lunged forward, bashing Edwin aside and taking control of the console. He fought and cursed and clawed at me. I cut our ship up off its intercepting trajectory, aimed us squarely back toward Earth, and cut our burn. The Skipping Stone pulled ahead of us, filling our field of view, and then dwindling.
			</p><p>Edwin shoved me off. I pulled myself back into my nav chair, happy to still be alive. He turned his chair about. I thought he would be angry, but instead he looked at me like a mournful old dog and said, “You fool. You’ve killed us.”
			</p><p>I shook my head. “We would have smashed to splinters against that thing. We weren’t nearly matching its—”
			</p><p>“We were a moment away from sync. I’d just dumped the hab and long-range modules. Lightened the load on the engines.
			</p><p>”You did what?” I looked back through the rear port of the command module. The hatch was shut. Through the clear panes I could see the edge of the rear boost ring where it had pulled forward to nestle with the forward ring. I should have been seeing through the narrow passage of the long-range sensor and comms module into the hab module, with the bunks, full-service head, the majority of the rations, and the powerful life support. My heart sank. I knew exactly how far our remaining fuel could get us, exactly how many days’ of stale rations were stored in the command module’s emergency kit, exactly how long a distress signal sent with the command module’s standard Earth-local grade systems would take to reach anyone, exactly how long the smaller life support would hold out.
			</p><p>We were exactly dead.
			</p><p>I looked at Edwin and tried to say something. Nothing came out. No words would be right. I looked past him to the big empty and the cruel stars, and waited.</p>

			<p>I swiped all the warnings off my screen and brought up the scan data of the passing monster. My stomach was flipping and churning from this mad flight, but it helped to have something to do. Needed a crevasse, not a peak, so if we missed our grapple we might hitch up against the slope. Better odds on surviving a crash than flipping off into the void. I also needed a high ferrous content for the mag-anchors to grab onto. We’d have had bore-anchors if this had been a mining rig, but ZT’s shuttles were just meant for ferrying about Earth-local, so why the bloody balls had I agreed to this mad jaunt anyway?
			</p><p>Never mind. The choices dwindled, and I made my pick. A deep valley on the Skipping Stone’s back, good composition, with an overhang or cave in the rear slope. Maybe the scientist in m was intrigued by the odd readings there, or maybe the caveman in me liked the idea of shelter. I checked for an intercept solution, saw that we could sync nicely, then sent the data to Edwin.
			</p><p>“Thanks,” he said. “I’m bringing us in.”
			</p><p>I wondered how we’d suddenly made up the velocity to sync, and remembered the hollow thuds and the ship’s sudden lurch. I looked back; the connecting hatch was sealed and I saw empty space and the rising edge of one of the Skipping Stone’s ridges where I should have seen into the hab module.
			</p><p>I succumbed to a wave of mania and howled, “Hah-hah! You mad genius! You’d better not bung this up now!”
			</p><p>Knuckles white on the main controls, Edwin gritted out, “Working on it!”
			</p><p>The crags rose higher to fore and aft like the Skipping Stone was swallowing us whole. The ride got rougher as the valley narrowed and the interplay of forces grew more complicated. Our velocities were nearly matched, but each tiny correction as we dodged encroaching outcrops sent up jets of volatiles boiled in the lash of our thrusters, bucking us off to the next collision course as we pushed ever downward. Proximity alarms piled up as we neared the bottom.
			</p><p>“Anchors!” shouted Edwin.
			</p><p>He didn’t have to tell me. I fired four in sequence, long monofilament lines spooling out behind electromagnetic anchors that latched onto ferrous deposits. The lines grew taut and onboard motors leveled us out and drew us the last few meters down to touch skids to the anomalous asteroid.
			</p><p>The quiet was astounding.
			</p><p>Edwin powered down the flight systems, gave the silence an appropriate few moments to settle in, then spun his chair about and crowed, “Bravely done!”
			vI said, “You’re off your tits.”
			</p><p>He snorted and said, “Victory isn’t for the timid. Everyone else is still staring at Mars, wondering why it hasn’t turned up, where their modes went wrong. And here we’ve actually <em>landed</em> on the thing! Ooh!” He set the computer recording and said, “’I, Dr. Edwin Haskell Rattleboot, along with Technician Rupert Coppens, claim the Skipping Stone in the name of ZenithTech R&D. We got here first because we’re a damn sight smarter than you, so you can piss off!’” He set that onto a repeat broadcast as far as our remaining comm gear could push it, so the message would be precede us as we neared Earth Local.
			</p><p>“I still don’t understand how you knew it would come <em>here</em>,” I said.
			</p><p>“Laborious deduction, dear Coppens. Everyone was studying the Stone every which way, so I looked where they weren’t.” He ticked points off his fingers as he professed his genius. “Firstly: every responsible scientist and agency was being so careful to treat this thing as a natural anomaly, soooo hesitant to even dare to whisper that there might be intelligence involved until we had evidence to back the claim. I tossed that out. I mean, look at its behaviors, its capabilities. The simplest, most logical explanation is that it’s not a coincidental wanderer, that it <em>wants</em> to come to Earth. Secondly: from its first turn about Neptune, we noted that its change in velocity couldn’t be accounted for by aerobraking and gravitational drag alone. But then it skipped and everyone myopically focused on <em>that</em>. I looked back at the worlds the Stone had passed over and looked for changes picked up by our probes. On each world I found a minute —really just very very tiny — increase in the rotational period, and a similarly teensy drop in the world’s gravitational pull. And do you know what I found?”

			<p>Edwin's eyes lit up and he said, "Yes, Brilliant! I found a correlation! Two of them, in fact. The amount of energy needed for each respective rotational increase correlated perfectly to the velocity change (adjusted for aerobraking and all). It was the same ratio every time. And the loss of strength in the gravitational field when compared to the distance traveled in each subsequent skip also resulted in a constant ratio. You see; it’s transferring energy. I don’t know how, but it’s dumping its inertia into each planet, but then siphoning off the planet’s own gravitational field to power the next jump. I... That’s completely impossible I know. Maybe it’s sucking up all the heavy elements? I don’t know, but it’s there. Furthermore, there’s a direct correlation between time spent in orbit and the decrease in gravitational pull. Using those as constants, I calculated that the Skipping stone had spent enough time over Jupiter to power the skip to Mars days ago. So, getting back to my first supposition, I—“
			</p><p>I cut him off. “You assumed its destination was Earth. Its skips have thus far adhered to direct courses; it’s jumping along a direct line, not teleporting willy-nilly, so you knew it would be coming along this vector based on Jupiter’s position relative to us. You worked out a range of terminal skip-points, worked out that we could reach them in a shuttle, shanghaied me and set sail.”
			</p><p>Edwin clicked his teeth, finger-gunned me and said, “Sharp as ever. That’s why I keep you a—”
			</p><p>I barreled on, saying, “Putting us both in a position where if just one of your many ‘ifs’ had been wrong, we would have died.”
			</p><p>“We’d have still had the long-range to boost a distress call, and the rations and life support to wait out a rescue. But I wasn’t wrong, see?” He gestured to the inhospitable black crags looming outside. “Going at this clip, the Stone will enter Earth orbit in about forty hours. We’ve got rations aplenty, and time to get to know this curious thing before anyone else gets their grubbies all over it.”
			</p><p>His enthusiasm was catching but I wasn’t ready to give into it quite yet. “That’s great, but if you could just acknowledge how insanely stupid and unethical it was to put my life on—”
			</p><p>“Hey, do you feel that?” He beamed, his too-big teeth seeming to multiply to fill the grin that spread across his face. He unbuckled, tapped his feet to nudge up away from his chair. His drift slowed, then reversed, and he settled back to his seat. “Feels like Lunar gravity. On a rock this small?” He bounded past me. “Get your helm. We’re going outside!”
			</p><p>I sighed. He was such a brilliant polymath, but it was easy to see how he ended up booted in disgrace from his cush position at the Frame Foundation and banished to the slow death of small-scope-small-budget projects at beleaguered ZTR&D. He was as impulsive as a squirrel on bath salts.
			</p><p>Outside, clam-shelled in our excursion kit, we watched the stars across the narrow band of sky and observed a moment of awe appropriate for being the first people in a strange new place. The Skipping Stone had a hard sort of beauty, with jagged planes and spires of crystalline stone vaulting up to pockmarked and scorched peaks. Wherever it had come from, it had come through an awful lot of abuse to get here.
			</p><p>“Would you look at that,” cooed Edwin. “You said it’s mostly carbonic, right?”
			</p><p>“That’s right.”
			</p><p>“So what’s blue in the crystalline metal deposits?” He was talking about broad zebra stripes of metallic material, composed of long faceted segments that ran vertically up the slopes. They were a dull grey, but with a blue sheen.
			</p><p>I checked my interface with the ship, which was still scanning. “I don’t know,” I said. “They’re really even, too. Same size, evenly spaced. That’s weird.”
			</p><p>Edwin swung his flashlight about and said, “Hey, there’s a cave!”
			</p><p>“Right!” I turned about, binging my own light to bear. “That’s why I chose…” I spluttered out as my light traced the shape of the opening. The cave was twice the height of a man, three times as wide. The stone was rough and wild, but the overall opening was very rectangular. Right angles about a deep darkness. “That um… Some minerals do cleave in right angles, so this could be…”
			</p><p>“Phah! Just like the rest of them!” Edwin angled his beam into the cave and upped the intensity. “Going to tell me that’s a natural formation, too?”
			</p><p>The back wall of the cave was vertical, rough at the edges, but smoothing to a sheer plane towards the center. There was an opening there, a regular hexagon three meters high, with a triangular slab hanging from the lintel like a tooth. It was as if someone designed the hexagon from six equilateral triangles, but hadn’t carved out the uppermost one. The wall around the entrance was covered in deep-carved symbols, roughly hexagonal clusters of pictograms or writing connected by sweeping spiral lines that radiated from the doorway.
			</p><p>The weight of the discovery settled on me and I whispered, “Great God.”
			</p><p>“Yours,” said Edwin, “Or theirs?” He let that hang in the air for a moment, then swept his hand toward the doorway and said, “Shall we?”

		<p>We went inside, bobbing around the door’s awkward hanging lintel. The interior had seemed utterly dark from the other side, but was filled with a sourceless light once we passed through. The room we called the Lobby was high-ceilinged and shaped like a flattened sphere. More carvings lined the polished walls.
			</p><p>“Fans of spirals, aren’t they?” said Edwin. It was true; spirals figured heavily in the pictograms. Clockwise and counter-, single- or multi-limbed, clusters of spirals inter-locked, Spirals with limbs that branched like fractals, carvings like a child's drawing of a tornado, which I realized were spirals seen from the side. The hexagonal motif was similarly prominent, though mostly as a framing or organizational guide. They used hexagons the way we used rectangles. Their printer paper was probably six-sided. If they had printers. I doubted it.
			</p><p>The tablet on my forearm pinged with green notices, and the display on my faceplate jiggled with atmospheric data. Atmosphere? I looked back. The doorway was open to space, to empty vacuum. There hadn’t been a film, field, or any sense of a membrane as we passed through the thing. But my suit was telling me the room had a safe, breathable atmosphere.
			</p><p>I barely had time to say, “That’s odd,” before Edwin popped his release toggles.
			</p><p>I shouted something worried or insulting. Probably both at once. Edwin just gulped down a lungful and laughed as the segments of his helm tucked themselves away behind his head.
			</p><p>“Seriously?” I banged my helm. “You’re supposed to be the one in charge here!”
			</p><p>“Pssshhhhh…” Edwin waved my worries off and walked to the nearest wall. “This is a gift to us, Rupert. It’s welcoming us in.” He touched a wall, gloved fingers tracing one of the lines that branched from cluster to cluster. “It’s writing. Code of some sort. Come see.”
			</p><p>I did as he bade. We’d already jumped past the end of reason, so I popped my helm, too. The line did indeed look like writing; each character’s shape was based off a hexagon or its internal intersections. These aliens were already starting to get boring.
			</p><p>“You're filming this, right?” asked Edwin. His own helmet-cam now perched over his shoulder, tracking wherever he looked.
			</p><p>“Of course. I want it documented when your recklessness finally kills you.”
			</p><p>He laughed and said, “You're such a grand friend!”
			</p><p>I shrugged and said, “You volunteered to be the canary. I'm going to give it some more time, make sure you're still singing before I pop my own cork.”
			</p><p>“Fair enough. This way!” He cut off across the room's shallow bowl of a floor. There was a gallery above, lined with niches containing stone objects, big as suitcases. The way up wasn't apparent, but there was a doorway on our level dead ahead. This entrance was blessedly without a lintel-tooth. I wondered if the architects were short, or if the lintel-tooth at the entrance served a function. There was more writing and pictograms clustered in hex-blobs around the door. Lines of writing converged into a spiral galaxy over the entrance. I was reminded of learning about shape-poems as a child, where you’d fit your writing into the shape of a tree or fish or what-have-you. It was as if the architects had discovered the concept, but stayed stuck on only two shapes.
			</p><p>The room beyond was ovoid again, with bulges in the floor and ceiling that rose toward each other. It was like standing inside a giant throat lozenge. The walls were beige stone and the sourceless light was honey-colored, increasing the resemblance. Two figures featured heavily in the writing on the walls: one was a yin-yang like glyph comprising two hexagons touching at one edge, one carved in negative space, the other in positive, each with their adjoining triangles reversed; the second symbol was two spiral-funnels of opposing chirality, drawn at a three-quarters angle, their points intersecting at a hexagonal plane. These two glyphs repeated all around the room with minor variances, surrounded with clouds of other symbols.
			</p><p>There was a sculpture suspended between the floor and ceiling bulges; a carved vortex of obsidian on its side, terminating at an amber pane. It was a three-dimensional representation of the second symbol, with only one spiral. There were no wires, no frame, the object just hung there, exactly between the two bulges.
			</p><p>“Astounding!” said Edwin. He stepped up the low slope, reaching out. Of course he was going to touch it.
			</p><p>I said, “You really shouldn’t,’ but my heart wasn’t in it.
			</p><p>He nudged the spiral part, and it didn't budge. “Come closer.”
			</p><p>I followed him, walking in at an angle to catch different shots than his own camera. It was truly suspended; I touched it myself, and it felt as solid as if it were embedded in amber, rather than in thin air. I zoomed in on the levitating six-sided pane; one of the triangular sections between one edge and the center where the spiral terminated was a much lighter shade than the other rest of the pane.
			</p><p>“Think it's some kind of focused maglev?” I asked.
			</p><p>Edwin shrugged. “Could be, but that's usually more slippery. More likely fine-tuned gravity manipulation. The Skipping Stone already showed a love for playing with forces beyond our understanding. Any guess we make is likely wrong at this point.” He pinched the pane. “Feels like solid glass. But there's some give. Oh!” He pushed the pane, and it slid along the length of the spiral. The center of the pane moved along the axis of the vortex as if it were a rail. The tubular, widening spiral passed through the pane like an illusion, though both parts seemed perfectly solid. There were no moving parts, no adjustment, the two just intersected and passed through one another despite all the laws of physics being broken. Edwin giggled in wonder and pushed the pane toward the widest end of the spiral.
			</p><p>“Edwin, don't!” I tried to stop him, but failed. Impulsive nit. The pane stopped when it reached the end of the spiral. It had passed me, so I saw the pane from the other side; the hues were reversed, the pane a pale amber from this side with a dark amber triangle. The angle was truncated, connecting the points of two sides to the much nearer spiral intersection.
			</p><p>Edwin tsked and said, “Stop being such a stick in the mud!”
			</p><p>“What if that's the throttle?” I almost shouted. “What if you've just shot us across the galaxy?”
			</p><p>Edwin said with a smirk, “This was left out to be found. They wouldn't have built the throttle <em>here</em>.”
			</p><p>“And you're an expert on alien feng shui now?”
			</p><p>Edwin made a finger-gun at me and pulled it back, clicking his cheek. “You and me both. We’re both now the most experienced experts on alien life the human race has ever had. How’dya like that?”
			</p><p>“I'm uh... I'm honestly not sure if you're taking it as seriously as I am.”
			</p><p>“Nonsense!” He laughed again. His ebullience was becoming off-putting. He turned for the exit, waving for me to follow. “Let's see what further wonders await!”
			</p><p>“Seriously,” I groaned to myself, “What's gotten into him?” He was already out the door, and I hustled after him. I stopped when a glimmer of light caught the corner of my eye. It was on the other side of the artifact, near where I had been standing opposite Edwin. I turned to look; it was a diaphanous uncurling drape of blue-violet, uncurling in the air like a silk drape in the breeze. It vanished when I turned to look at it head-on, and I took it for a flare on my helm's visor. But then it appeared again, a little closer, a little better defined, faint brilliances pulsing though empty air, defining a shape perhaps like a polyp, or perhaps like a vehicle's control yoke... made of lace and light. It's not a great metaphor, I know. It was a shifting, amorphous thing, but it was there, not two meters away and drifting closer.

			<p>I took that as my cue to beat a hasty retreat. I didn’t know what it was, didn’t want to, and certainly didn’t want to be alone with it. “Edwin!” I shouted as I left the chamber, “Edwin where are you?”
			</p><p>“Up here!” His voice echoed strangely, colored with a joyful excitement completely at odds with what I was feeling. “Come up the ramp! This is astounding!”
			</p><p>“Ramp? What ramp?” I stood just outside the lozenge chamber, looking back to check on my ghost: there was no sign of the thing. I turned back toward the Lobby. There had been no ramps before, I was sure of it. But now there they were, one to each side of the lozenge chamber entrance, sweeping up to the gallery above. “Were these ramps here before?”
			</p><p>“Just get up here!”
			</p><p>	I hustled up the ramp to the right; they both terminated over the main entrance, at a shared landing that flowed onto the gallery. The gallery ran the full circumference of the Lobby, was a couple of meters wide, and had no rail, which I felt was an offensive oversight. Now that I was face-to-face with the niches lining the gallery, I saw the objects held within in greater detail: they floated unsupported, geodesic orbs with twelve or more sides, big enough to bear hug. They seemed to be carved from black marble, each facet shining black with cloud-like motes and whorls of grey and green. I reached out to touch one and it twitched, rotating half a turn on one axis, then another.
			</p><p>“Bollocks!” I pulled my hand back, cursing myself more than anything; there was already one impulsive fool here, and it wouldn’t do for me to add to the total idiocy quotient. I turned and ran around the gallery, past the levitating faceted orbs (some of which were still, while others twitched or slowly rotated) to where Edwin waited, silhouetted in another doorway directly over the entrance to the Lozenge Chamber.
			</p><p>He said, “What took you so long?” as I approached.
			</p><p>“I saw something,” I panted. “Something... a ghost.”
			</p><p>“A ghost?” He barked a laugh, then bit it off, and gave me a serious and apologetic look. “I hope you filmed it. I shouldn't laugh; just look where we are. There's no end to the wonders we might find here. Just look at this!” He pulled me closer to look through the doorway. The room was round again, the walls covered in more writing. The floor and ceiling didn't bulge toward each-other here. The far wall was dominated by two statues, situated at ten and two o'clock, if you counted the entrance as six. They were black stone, like the twitchy icosahedrons outside. One appeared to be a bit of a svelte mushroom with jointed fern-bits that might have been arms and a jeweled eggbeater for a crown. The other looked a bit like someone trying to make a spider of their hand; many jointed limbs, with a general sense that they weren’t in the right place. These were my first impressions, but the sculptures could have been anything; their style seemed more broad-stroke abstract than realistic… though what did I know?
			</p><p>Each statue held something in upraised limbs, just over our heads. Perhaps they held the same thing; it was hard to tell. There was a blurring in the air between their hands, buzzing, as if something were moving back and forth between one statue’s hands (not at all the right word) and the other’s, morphing and moving faster than thought. The buzzing sound would periodically ease and for a moment the object would settle on one statue or another, gaining clarity and definition for just a moment. But just as I began to see an edge, discern a hint of the overall shape, it would blur anew.
			</p><p>“Amazing, isn’t it?”
			</p><p>I gaped, panning slowly to record everything, and said, “What the hell is it?”
			</p><p>Edwin pulled me forward and said, “Let’s find out, shall we?”
			</p><p>We passed a pedestal that rose from the floor near the entrance. It was a bit like a bird bath or lingam, black with a blue resin or fluid in the basin, so still and lustrous it looked solid. The blue matter vaporized into a cloud as we passed, splattering us both with tiny droplets. My visor misted blue. We both flinched back, but Edwin was closer, and jumped back against me, shouting. I grabbed on by instinct, even I was falling back. I crashed against the wall with him in my arms and slid down. I wiped the gunk from my visor as Edwin gasped and writhed. The blue droplets covered his bare skin, and they moved of their own accord, gathering and sinking in through his pores, up his nose, into his eyes as I watched. I screamed, pinned under him and utterly helpless to do anything as his body was invaded.
			</p><p>His breath stopped. His body went utterly still. Deadweight pinning me down.
			</p><p>“Edwin,” I gasped, “Edwin!” 
			</p><p>He shuddered, his eyes focused on the far wall and he laughed.
			</p><p>“Edwin!” I feared some sort of mania had taken hold as his body was invaded. “Edwin what’s wrong? What’s it done to you?”
			</p><p>“Time! Ha-hah!”
			</p><p>“What? What?” I struggled to get out from under him so I could help him up and back to the ship.
			</p><p>“Time!” he repeated. He pointed at the far wall, at yet another spiral sigil. “The symbol! It starts at a single point and moves outward, branching onto different paths; it’s a representation of time and probability it — I can read!” He shoved up off me and dropped to his knees before the sigil, tracing his fingers over the surrounding cloud of writing as he read.
			</p><p>I crept next to him, watching him as his eyes roved over the writing. “Um, Edwin,” I said. “We should get you back to the ship. You’ve just been—”
			</p><p>“I’m fine.” He waved me away. And he really did look fine, not at all like he’d just had his integument breached by an alien substance. He was completely engrossed, exactly how any mad scientist like Edwin would be if he could suddenly read an alien language. He chattered as he read. “Astounding, isn’t it? There was no way they could have known even the rough basics of our biology from across the millions of light years. Our psyche, physiology, neurology, genetic structure. They somehow created an agent adaptable enough to deliver their language into any sort of being.”
			</p><p>I sat back, resigning myself. “You’re really reading that?”
			</p><p>Edwin nodded.
			</p><p>“What’s it say?”
			</p><p>He paused, frowned, then shook his head. “I understand it, in a way, but I… it’s written more like poetry. Verse for an alien mind. Translating won’t be easy.”
			</p><p>“Are you really not going to stop for even a basic exam, make sure there’s nothing growing inside you?”
			</p><p>“Nope.” His finger settled on a glyph. “‘The soul opens the way.’”
			</p><p>I clunked my helmeted head back against the wall and muttered, “Mumbo-jumbo.” I slapped his arm. “Look, this is amazing and all, but your lack of caution is pissing me off. Frightening me, to be honest. I don’t understand what’s come over you. You’re just accepting every little thing this place offers you like it’s a gift, a toy, without even a second thought.”
			</p><p>“And it’s working splendidly. See?” He turned away from the writing and smiled at me, a big, winning grin with his too-big teeth. “Still alive.”
			</p><p>“Have you seen even one space movie?”
			</p><p>“I’ve seen them all. Popcorn fun, but think it through. What’s the point of being a monster warlord when you’re this advanced? Idiots fight. Intelligent beings communicate. The Skipping Stone is meant for us. It’s a message for Earth, and we get to read it first!” He grabbed my helmet and planted a cartoony kiss on my visor, ending with a smacking <em>mwah!</em> “It's  just so damn exiting I could burst! I only wish you would share the spirit of this moment with me.”</p>
